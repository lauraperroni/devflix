The Streaming for learning tech concepts!
</h3>

Hello!

This project was built after learning the concepts through a DIO course called "Recriando a Interface do Netflix". I made some changes to the code to better fit my own vision and the main idea of the project, as well as some fixes to the overall structure.

It is still under construction, but the goal is to create a streaming-style website that hosts free tech courses, bootcamps, tools, learning resources, and much more, helping anyone who wants to learn but can’t afford to pay for knowledge.

At first, the platform will link to external resources, but in the future I hope to host everything directly on the website, develop a back-end and database, and deploy it as a real, fully functional application. 🙂

Feel free to contribute!
